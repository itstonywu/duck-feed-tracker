# Full Stack Assessment

This is a full stack application written in TypeScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client).

## Overview

### Objective

The task of this project was to create a web application to understand how ducks are being fed from parks around the word.

### Approach to the problem

A one-to-many relationship is derived from an assumption that for a given park, there would be multiple entries about the food that was fed to the ducks. Static pages are generated for each location where an user could add many entries. A table view is created for the researcher to look at all collected entries.

### Technology Stack

The technology stack was chosen to create a minimum MVP while minimizing the amount of repetitive CRUD boilerplate. Next.js provides a way to build [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) out of the box, without having to build a separate backend. Prisma is a great tool to quickly model data and offers type safety through autogenerated types. Chakra UI was chosen since has simple to use components with accessibility in mind. [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) was added to provide an real-time user experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `Location` and `Entry` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Now, seed the database with the sample data in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) by running the following command:

```
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. Start the application

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to explore the UI.
